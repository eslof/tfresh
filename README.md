# TotemSequence aka tfresh
Addon that takes 4 slots and updates a castsequence macro.<br>
By default it will sequence the first 4 slots of page 2 on the default bar.<br>
<br>
I keep my "standard" buff totems on page 2 and move them around and run /tfresh command to acommodate the group I get.<br>
This will update/create a macro called TotemSequence on your character macro page to bind.

## Usage: /tfresh conditions<br>
Short-hand for no condition is 0.<br>
<br>
Ex.: /tfresh 0 -> no reset condition.<br>
/tfresh 8/combat -> reset at 8sec or combat end.
